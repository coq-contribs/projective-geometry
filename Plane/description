Description: This is a formalization of projective plane geometry. Two
axiom systems are shown equivalent. We prove some results about the
decidability of the the incidence and equality predicates. The classic
notion of duality between points and lines is formalized thanks to a
functor. The notion of 'flat' is defined and flats are characterized.
